 * Returns the inverse Jaccard similarity, i.e. as distance rather than
 * similarity. Returns a value in [0..1] interval: 0.0 if `a` and `b` are equal,
 * or 1.0 if none of the components match.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The sizes of both input vectors MUST be equal. All non-zero vector component
 * values are treated equal.
