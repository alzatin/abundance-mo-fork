// // Getting back to old-maslow-create

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
to-do-fix

now:
    - import svg 
    - import stp? 
   - feat: thumbnails
   - bug :need to change unit ratio because i can't quite zoom in into the piece
    - BUG: make sure BOM is getting deleted if molecule gets recomputed/ recompile!
  
    - FEAT: Print object bounds option to let user know how big their object is?  
    - BUG: uncaught in promise error will break everything, must have a way of resetting, won't throw more errors after

    - Q: is bom working in multiple levels or just doing BOM for current active molecule? if inputs change (if molecule is recomputed) it should probably recompile. Should bom recompile after molecule recompute instead of active atom?
    
    - Revise try catch worker error management/ i don't think it's working 
    - Alert error message for molecules not working or failing

    - need to start implementing for UX alerts, (a.e.can't find tag), it's hard to tell when i'm doing something wrong in rendering vs when something is breaking. (this.alert message not working )

    - model some things :S [deckle box, stool] > need to start creating new actions with gitmolecules otherwise it's very hard to model anything.
    
    - Cut layout should separate by height
    - Bug : LEVA input error ? - seems like its wire 
    
mid :
    - our own filtering?
    - multiple atom selection 
    - BUG: if we create multiple inputs without changing the name, they won't show in menu 
    - replicad packing? 
    - fix shortcut button
    - github search needs css help
    - hull (in april? waiting for replicad)
    - tag drop downs for extract tag
    - github topic filter search
    - BOM summary / fix inputs
    - add labels to molecule
    - REDO login/browse to use link/reroute
    - allow filtering of projects
    - nest
    - implement three/drei wireframe?
    - GET request sometimes failing at browsing for projects
    - Face lift for project browse and new project (later)
    - Check on accuracy of draw projection in SVG
    - add missing icons BOM,etc, change maslow icon
    - goUp molecule still not working correctly
    - some places still have JSCAD code // clean up
    - BOM summary when molecule is active , button to download
    - Fix gitmolecule search bar max quota issue
    - Top molecule - choose units of measurement 
      - maybe in run mode, inputs should have ranges instead of open numbers

future:

    - Zoom in camera on load to bounding box for renderer
    -  import parts ?
    - make sample project with readme walkthrough or sandbox
    - CSS Overhaul , make global fonts, margins, colors
    - keyboard commands r-e-10
    - Feature : toggle atoms for finished project (a.e selection==1 rectangular top selection==2 circular top )

Qs :
  

    Modeling:
        - What is the most efficient modeling strategy for joinery? , make all parts and on assembly cut one that will in turn cut the other?

    Dev:
        - will changing inputs not damage model if modeled objects are not tied by planes. A.E. if a screw is modeled in the center of a face, if the face changes position will the screw not be left in the wrong place since its location wasn't modeled off the face?
        - in an assembly, would it be useful to have a list of the tags it contains and be able to filter them on/off?
